# MPAC DApp

# The MPAC DApp enables the exchange of EVM-compaitble tokens (i.e. ETH, Arbitrum, Fantom, Chainlink) for tokenized digital assets representing real-world investment vehicles such as companies, funds, real estate, bonds. MPAC DeFi democratizes investments in entities that would otherwise be challenging to invest in for people who are excluded from participation.
